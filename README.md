#Overview
This project contains several samples that uses [AWS Command Line Interface](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
to place workloadx into [Amazon EC2 Container Service](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/).

#Prerequisites
* a working [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) evironment or [container](https://github.com/kurron/docker-aws-cli)
* a working [AWS ECS](https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/) evironment

#Building
These files are simply fed into the AWS CLI so there isn't anything to build.

#Installation
Nothing besides the prerequisites need to be installed. 

##Environment Variables
The AWS CLI and wrapping convenience scripts expects some variables to be specified in the environment:

* AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
* AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
